- ⚡ Fun fact: “It turns out my life events have a weird sense of timing with movie releases. 

When I graduated from college, there was a blockbuster with a graduation-themed twist, complete with cap-throwing choreography. Landed my first job? You guessed it; there’s a workplace comedy hitting theaters that day, perfectly mirroring the absurdity of adulting. 

It is as if my life has its own script, and Hollywood keeps stealing my storylines. But I’m just here for the laughs, really. Hopefully, the sequel would bring more popcorn and fewer plot twists!”
